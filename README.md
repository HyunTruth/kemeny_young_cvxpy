# kenemy_young_cvxpy
A heuristic implementation of kemeny-young method (a rank aggregation method) as a LP program for quicker computation.

Implemented in cvxpy, python 3.

This implementation is based on the following paper:
V Conitzer, A Davenport, J Kalagnanam. [Improved bounds for computing Kemeny rankings](http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-099.pdf), 2006.

`.ipynb` has the executable jupyter notebook file, and `.py` is the reference execution code.
